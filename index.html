                <li>The plots of his novels often involve the resurfacing of unresolved or misinterpreted events in the past, murders, or fatal accidents and have multiple twists.
                <li> Among his novels are two series, each involving the same protagonist set in and around New York and New Jersey, and some characters appear in both.
                <li>Coben is the creator of the British crime drama television show The Five, which first aired on April 2016 on the Sky 1 channel in the United Kingdom.
                <li>Coben has won an Edgar Award, a Shamus Award and an Anthony Award. He is the first writer to have received all three. He is also the first writer in more than a decade to be invited to write fiction for the New York Times op-ed page. He wrote a short story, "The Key to My Father," which appeared on June 15, 2003.
                <li>Tell No One, his first stand-alone thriller since the creation of the Myron Bolitar series in 1995, was published in 2001. It is his best-selling novel to date. Director Guillaume Canet made a French-language film based on the book, titled Ne le dis à personne, in 2006. Coben followed Tell No One with nine more stand-alone novels. His novel Hold Tight, released on April 15, 2008, was his first book to debut at number 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list.
